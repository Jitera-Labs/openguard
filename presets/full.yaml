# OpenGuard Full Preset — exercises all guard types (used by integration tests)
guards:
  # Secrets detection runs FIRST — must see original messages before any PII redaction
  # (pii_filter would otherwise redact Slack token segments and GitHub PATs before we can block them)
  # scan_input_only: true prevents broad patterns from being registered as stream_blocks,
  # which would cause "incorrect header check" errors when they match in LLM streaming output.
